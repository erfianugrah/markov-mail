# 📚 Documentation Index (Reset)

This branch is the decision-tree reboot of Markov Mail. Everything in this folder tracks the new baseline; the legacy write-ups were deleted.

## ✅ Active References

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[../README.md](../README.md)** | Project overview + current goals.
| **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** | High-level view of the slimmed-down Worker + offline tooling.
| **[DETECTORS.md](DETECTORS.md)** | Inventory of the feature extractors that still exist.
| **[SCORING.md](SCORING.md)** | Snapshot of the decision-tree based scoring flow.
| **[TRAINING.md](TRAINING.md)** | Minimal training/checklist for exporting trees.
| **[DECISION_TREE.md](DECISION_TREE.md)** | Detailed exporter instructions + schema.
| **[API_DECISION_TREE.md](API_DECISION_TREE.md)** | Lightweight request/response quickstart for the reset Worker.
| **[CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md)** | How to ship `config.json` + `decision_tree.json` via KV.
| **[CALIBRATION.md](CALIBRATION.md)** | Quick reminder that calibration happens offline now (no runtime knobs).
| **[INVENTORY.md](../INVENTORY.md)** | Placeholder for the current decision-tree artifact inventory.
| **[CLI/README](../cli/README.md)** | Current CLI quickstart (deploy/config/analytics + feature export).

The legacy docs have been removed from this branch. If you need to reference them, check the git history (pre-reset tags) or your favorite archive.

### Risk Scoring Strategy

This reset branch uses a single JSON decision tree loaded from KV:

1. Middleware assembles a deterministic feature vector (plus-risk, sequential confidence, linguistic/structural stats, domain reputation, entropy, etc.).
2. `decision_tree.json` is fetched once per isolate and cached for ~60s; leaves carry both the probability (`value`) and a human-readable `reason`.
3. Hard blockers (invalid format, disposable domains) short-circuit before the tree. Otherwise, the leaf score (`0..1`) is compared against the configured warn/block thresholds.

The Worker logs `decisionTreeReason`, `decisionTreePath`, and `modelVersion` so you can audit every block/warn. See [SCORING.md](SCORING.md) + [DECISION_TREE.md](DECISION_TREE.md) for details.

npm run cli kv:list --binding CONFIG  # List KV keys
npm run cli kv:get <key>              # Get KV value
npm run cli analytics:query <sql>     # Run D1 SQL via /admin/analytics
npm run cli analytics:stats --last 24 # Built-in analytics summaries

# Testing
npm run cli test:api <email>          # Test API endpoint
npm run cli test:detectors            # Test pattern detectors
npm run cli test:generate --count 100 # Generate test data

# A/B Testing
npm run cli ab:create                 # Create experiment
npm run cli ab:analyze                # Analyze results
npm run cli ab:stop                   # Stop experiment

# Configuration
npm run cli config:list               # List all config
npm run cli config:sync --remote      # Sync to production
```

**For detailed usage, workflows, and examples:** See [CLI Reference](../cli/README.md).

The sections that used to live here (detection capabilities, analytics, long-form release notes) were deleted with the reset. New write-ups will land once the decision-tree workflow stabilizes.
